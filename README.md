# Alternatives to ggmap API in R

With the recent changes to Google API, the ggmap library is no longer totally free to use (you can read more about it here). I was wondering what other alternatives there are in R to make not only beautiful, but useful maps with all the ggplot machinery at your hands.

Although, the new API charges may not be pricey for moderate use, if you use ggmap sparingly, like me, the service might just not be worthy. So, what other R resources are out there?

  1. The old but trusted shape file

  2. Ggmap with Open Source maps
